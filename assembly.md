# Repl.it Ravioli Assembly Instructions

## Introduction
(Insert life story about pasta or something here)

## Ingredients
- Ravioli Dough
- Ravioli Filling
- Repl.it Ravioli Mold

## Instructions
1. Roll out a piece of your pasta dough to ~1/8" using either a pasta machine or rolling pin
2. Cut a piece of dough which is 40mm x 40mm or just slightly larger than your ravioli mold.
3. Lay the piece of dough over the mold and press it into the crevices. BE GENTLE, raw pasta dough breaks EASILY.
4. Add your filling so there is just a little more than enough to fill the crevices.
5. Lay another piece of pasta dough on top.
6. Using a fork's tips, press around the edge of the dough, sealing the pasta pieces together. Then, cut the excess dough off of the outside of the mold.
7. Gently remove the finished ravioli from the mold and place on a tray to be put in the freezer, which will allow the ravioli to hold their shape.
