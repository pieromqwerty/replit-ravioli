# Printing the Ravioli Mold

1. Download the repo by clicking on the "Download to ZIP" button on the main page.
2. Extract the zip file.
3. Bring the MOST RECENT .obj file from within the extracted zip into your slicer of choice. Some printers have been pre-sliced, so check out the `pre-sliced` folder to see if your 3D printer is supported.
  - Use a food-safe filament, such as PLA. You ***DO NOT*** want chemicals in your food.
  - The quality of the print does not matter too much, but do make sure to use a raft while printing.
  - Let the print cool completely before making ravioli in it.
  - The ravioli mold should be 30mm across, but you may go as large as you would like to go.
4. Once sliced, bring your file over to your printer and print it!
